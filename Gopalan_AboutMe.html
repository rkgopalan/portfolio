          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">There has always been a flame restlessly burning for greatness inside of me. From a young a age, I have used this fire to light my athletic journey. There was a spark when I played the sport of table tennis. My ambitious and competitive mindset
            helped me climb to the top, but it wasn't enough. My drive had to join forces with my brain to overcome the obstacle of time and tough competition. This perfect combination led me to many titles at the national and state level in table tennis.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">As a coming of age, the time to direct my focus to a career was approaching. The competitive world of engineering spoke to me right away. My competitive experience could really give me an edge. I didn't want follow the stereotyped computer science
            pathway of the past generations. I wanted to be apart of the first step into the uncharted territories of our modern world. The potentials of Artificial Intelligence in this modern world fascinated me. My goal in high school was to use the
            presented opportunities to build of a foundation for this new dream of mine. I realized the knowledge from my athletic journey had already been the start of this foundation. Like before, I hoped my fire would guide and push me into higher
            levels.
          </p>
          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">Entering high school a freshman, the two base engineering courses presented was a place I could start. Unfortunately, I was one of the people who couldn't be a part of this start due to unforeseen circumstances. This was a disappointment as
            I felt behind the students of my class. I didn't allow this to stop me, and began preparing to enter the engineering academy. I was selected, and new hope kindled inside of me. I began to notice that Data Science was changing the world around
            me, and pursuing this career could allow me to be a part of this change. Statistics was a concept essential for Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, so I took rigorous math courses over the summer to reach this course.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 10pt;">In my Principles of Engineering class as a sophomore, I have gotten my first touches of coding through Netlogo and RobotC. It seemed really cool to me that, I have control over what happens in this world and with the machine I built. I felt
            as proud as winning a medal while playing sports when coding my creation. I also began to take a liking to the mechanical projects we did. It was another side of engineering that really let me be creative. I learned through the job shadowing
            field trips offered at my school that exposing yourself to as much as you can was the best thing to do. It could create new doors for that me that I can possibly open in the future. Just because it wasn't the career I intended to pursue, didn't
            mean I shouldn't apply myself. In the 2018 entrepreneurship project, I truly experienced how important coding was to executing the product or idea we had. This could mean creating an app to work in conjunction with the product or a website
            to market the product. Afterall, being a good coder was a step closer to a career in Data Science and could definitely widen the scope of what I can do as an engineer. I knew I couldn't just sit around and wait until junior year to get enrichment
            I needed. To prepare for the future I had to take advantage of the enrichment courses available to me online , and sharpen my coding knowledge through competition. </p>

              The objective of this project was to design an app through the MIT App Inventor software. Brainstorming went very well with both group members equally enthusiastic towards creating an app that would quiz players on different logos. Programming in App
              Inventor was where it got tough for us because of the odd syntax and my unfamiliarity towards it in general. It took a lot of trial and error, and our progress was slow at first. This process took large amounts of time and I had to take
              the initiative of organizing our priorities to meet the deadline. As other requirements of our project like the design notebook were getting caught up, me and my partner were able to confidently spend more time troubleshooting and improving
              the code. I began watching some youtube tutorials for inspiration and took the feedback from the beta walk very seriously . This is when our project began to take off in a positive manner. I improved at programming in App Inventor and the
              development of our app was smoother and more enjoyable now. Changing to a multiple choice format after the beta was a great decision that eliminated many previous cons. In the final gallery walk, we observed a great improvement with the
              amount of positve feedback increasing and negative feedback decreasing. There were still some minor issues we could have fixed with more time, but we definitely gave it our best with our given knowledge and time.

              The objective of this project was to create a complete, fully functional hangman game that initiated using the function hangman(). The course had given me a lot practice with functions in python and it was time to put it to test. Me and my teammate Joey
              worked exceptionally well throughout the course of this project. We had worked together previously, so our chemistry was great. As this project had a lot of creative freedom and wasn't documentation heavy, we were both able to work on the
              python program. We decided not take our usual flowchart approach with the code this time around. Therefore, we had to logically maneuver though project as we coded. It was definitely tough coding without having everything planned out, but
              it also gave us more freedom. Having a partner helped for this improvisation type of coding as when one ran into road block, another could help think of solution. Two minds really are better than one! When others got to try out our hangman, we realized
              there were a lot of small things that could enhance the user's gameplay. Finding these things got easier with additional feedback. For example, people might have entered their answers with the wrong casing or spacing but still got it wrong. Errors 
              like these were steadily fixed to make our game really stand out. At the end of this project, I can successfully say that I have mastered using functions python. We even had time to add ascii art before the deadline.

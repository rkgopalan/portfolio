                             The objective of this project was to design an app 
                             through the MIT App Inventor software. 
                            Brainstorming went very well with both group members 
                            equally enthusiastic towards 
                            creating an app that would quiz players on different logos. 
                             Programming in App Inventor was where 
                            it got tough for us because of the odd syntax and 
                            my unfamiliarity towards it in general. It took a 
                            lot of trial and error, and our progress was slow 
                            at first. This process took large amounts of time 
                            and I had to take the initiative of organizing our 
                            priorities to meet the deadline. As other 
                            requirements of our project like the design notebook
                            were getting caught up, me and my partner were able 
                            to confidently spend more time troubleshooting and 
                            improving the code. 
                            I began watching some youtube tutorials for
                            inspiration and took the feedback from the beta walk very seriously
                             . This is when our project began to 
                            take off in a positive manner. I improved at programming in
                            APP Inventor and the development of our app was 
                            smoother and more enjoyable now. Changing to a 
                            multiple choice format after the beta was a great decision
                            that eliminated many previous cons. In the final 
                            gallery walk, we observed a great improvement with the 
                            amount of positve feedback increasing and negative feedback decreasing.
                            There were still some minor issues we could have 
                            fixed with more time, but we definitely gave it our 
                            best with our given knowledge and time.
